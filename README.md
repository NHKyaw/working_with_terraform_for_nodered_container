**Terraform Docker Node-RED Deployment**
This repository demonstrates how to automate the deployment of a Node-RED Docker container using Terraform. It includes configurations to set up a Docker container, manage persistent data with volumes, and handle local permissions on a Windows environment.

**üöÄ Overview**
This project uses Terraform to automate the deployment of a Node-RED instance in a Docker container. The configuration pulls the official nodered/node-red Docker image, creates a Docker container with the appropriate port mapping, and sets up a local volume for persistent storage.

**Key steps include:**

Docker Image: Fetching and running the official Node-RED Docker image.
Randomized Container Name: Using Terraform‚Äôs random_string resource to create unique container names.
Port Mapping: Exposing Node-RED‚Äôs default port 1880 for external access.
Volume Management: Setting up local storage and permissions for Node-RED‚Äôs data directory.
Provisioning: Running a null_resource to ensure the directory and permissions are set on the local machine.

**üõ† Prerequisites**
Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed:
Terraform
Docker
A Windows-based system (as this repository contains Windows-specific file handling)

**üì• Getting Started**
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:


```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-docker-nodered.git
cd terraform-docker-nodered

## 2. Initialize Terraform
Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform configuration and download the required providers:
```
terraform init
##3. Apply the Terraform Configuration
Run terraform apply to create the Docker container and set up the local volume with the correct permissions:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
You‚Äôll be prompted to confirm the action by typing yes. Terraform will then create the Docker container, download the required image, set up the volume, and assign the necessary permissions.

4. Access Node-RED
After the container is running, you can access Node-RED through your web browser:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:1880
You should be able to start using Node-RED for flow-based programming.

üîß Configuration Details
Docker Provider: Using kreuzwerker/docker to manage Docker containers.
Random String Resource: Ensures each container name is unique by generating a random string.
Volume Mount: Maps C:/Users/NHK/Desktop/Terraform/noderedvol from your Windows system to the /data directory inside the container, ensuring data persists even if the container is removed or recreated.
Permissions: icacls is used to grant full access to the volume folder for the Everyone group on Windows.
üìù Example Terraform Code
Here‚Äôs a simplified view of the key components in the Terraform configuration:

hcl
Copy code
resource "docker_container" "nodered_container" {
  count = 1
  name  = join("-", ["nodered", random_string.random[count.index].result])
  image = docker_image.nodered_image.image_id
  ports {
    internal = 1880
    external = 1880
  }
  volumes {
    container_path = "/data"
    host_path      = "C:/Users/NHK/Desktop/Terraform/noderedvol"
  }
}
‚ö° Key Learnings

**üõ† Technologies Used**
Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used to manage Docker container deployment.
Docker: Containerization platform used to run Node-RED.
Node-RED: Flow-based programming platform for integrating and automating various devices and services.
